## AutoValue-Improved

I hijacked this from Google's open-source Java source code generators
(found at https://github.com/google/auto). I'm mostly interested in the
@AutoValue annotation, but I wanted to see how hard it would be to alter it to
use the step-builder pattern
(https://www.jayway.com/2012/02/07/builder-pattern-with-a-twist/) by default.
